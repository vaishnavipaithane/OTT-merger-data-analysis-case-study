# OTT Merger Data Analysis - LioCinema x Jotstar

This data analysis and visualization project is based on a mock business case provided by [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge). The goal was to provide strategic insights to support the merger of two OTT platforms, **LioCinema** and **Jotstar**, using real-world analytical techniques.

The project involves SQL-based data exploration and Power BI dashboard creation to analyze content libraries, user behavior, subscription trends, watch time, and revenue impact.

## Problem Statement

Lio, a leading telecom provider in India, is planning a strategic merger with Jotstar, one of the country’s most prominent streaming platforms. The goal is to combine LioCinema’s subscriber base with Jotstar’s content library to become the dominant OTT player in India.

The management team at Lio wants to analyze platform performance, content consumption, subscriber behaviour, upgrade/downgrade trends, and inactivity patterns from **Jan–Nov 2024**.

As the assigned analyst, my task was to uncover business insights and make data-driven recommendations to help position **Lio-Jotstar** as the leading OTT platform post-merger.
